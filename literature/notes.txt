102 camera trap projects, 21 countries predominatly EU, NA

between year - within-year comparison
5400 locations, 311.208 camera days nefore and during pandemic

sites with change in human activity to mimic human presence

163 mammal species

meta analytic, mixed effect model: species traits, landsacape modification, site characteristics, change in human activity

human activity: 100 fold decrease -> 10 fold increase


Results:
1,065 responses: one per species per project

overall mean change: near-zero, -0.04

trophic group (combining body mass and trophic level) as strongest predictor for change in animal activvity in response to human activity

largest increase: large herbivore; strongest decrease: carnivore

animal activity in higher human acitivity area increases with human activity - species filter: gulo gulo is absent from sites with high modification; 

timing:
more nocturnatility as human acitivity increases
strongest predictor: human landscape modification index
large carnivore: notabky more nocturnal than other groups
hunted animals are more nocturnal than unhunted ones, especially the more human activity

animals being attracted to anthropogenic ressources, nocturnal to minimize encounters

methods:
call for standardized images
script:
	traps are situated in COVID-19 affected area
	minimum of 7 cameras sampled
	min 7 days per camera
	human activity: trend recorded from camera or lockdown data avaible (local knowledge??)

detections: animals >= 1kg
no local animals (database)

mean: 42 (6-300) cameras per project

camera locations were cnsidered indepenedent within projects (no paired camera, suppl tab 10)

experimental design:
human activity: independent, if > 30min from previous detection
-> trend for one location / sampling effort(?)
-> variation -> control and treatment, less and more human activity, regardless of covid 19

start and end date of each period: visual detection on daily level or local lockdowns

priotized: between year analysis for similar period before 2020 (95 projects); if not avaible: onset of lockdowns march 2020 (dates chosen according to regulations)
if several potential treatments: (1) the fewest seasonal or ecological confounds; (2) the most similar study design; (3) the greatest sampling effort; and (4) the most recent time period. Of the 95 projects for which we made comparisons between 2020 and a previous year, we used 2019 for 88 projects, 2018 for 6 and 2017 for 1.

if not sifficient data: local knowledge of human activities (lockdown dates, visitor daata)

--> final categoriztion shared with contributors, asked for confounding factors (env. variation eg fire, drought...) 
-> 102 projects with detectable change in human activity

data analysis:
amount and timing of animal activity

model for single species detection: neg binomial, offset for camera days, random intercept for camera locations
glmmTMB used in R

timing:
detection classified as day/night using UTC -> sun angles

nocturnality index: detenctions duting night / all detections; for all species which had at least 10 observations in treat and control
log risk ratio RR: ln(observation high human activity / obs low human) -> positive: more nocturnality with increasing human activity
